do we destroy something
by naming it?

stuffing complexity
into a sorted box
in search of peace.

don't you know
we transcend it?

forcing order out
of what knows
no boundaries,
we desicate
embodied art

the current was not born
to be understood.
float on her river and let
it bring you to wherever
it empties
