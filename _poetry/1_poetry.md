i am grieving my death
within life again.
recurring like the tide.

incarnation is not meant
for the dead
but the living.

i return to constants
in some purgatory
and vanish once more to be
reborn

how many stories have i lived,
dieties have i worshipped,
characters have i enacted,
impermanent and transient as we are

maybe it's a blessing
that pain engulfs
the absence of what is
never again to be
