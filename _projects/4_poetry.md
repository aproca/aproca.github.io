The invisible thread <br/>
I've tied to your foot <br/>
only grows longer.

I’m reading the same words you once did. <br/>
I still listen to your songs <br/>
and take the right side of the bed. <br/>
I don’t know who your heart beat for last <br/>
Or what’s floating in your head.

<!-- I'm speaking through what <br/>
I know, <br/>
reading the same words, <br/>
listening to the sounds you will, <br/>
imagining. -->

Maybe you're near <br/>
because you wake every <br/>
night that I sleep. <br/>
We once said I was the sun <br/>
and you the moon.
