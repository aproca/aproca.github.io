the invisible thread <br/>
i've tied to your foot <br/>
only grows longer

i'm speaking through what <br/>
i know, <br/>
reading the same words, <br/>
listening to the sounds you will, <br/>
imagining.

maybe you're near <br/>
because you wake every <br/>
night that i sleep <br/>
we once said i was the sun <br/>
and you the moon
