The road by the river I walked every day, <br/>
near skate park and sand pits, <br/>
blue melting from sky into water, <br/>
sun reddening my cheeks, <br/>
admiring the bare bodies <br/>
swimming, laying, smoking.

The faces I love because <br/>
they are my home.

On my last nights, I <br/>
stood outside the bar in winter air, <br/>
the windows a film screen of <br/>
people laughing, drinking, dancing, <br/>
in a reality existing outside of me.

When we lose something, we are <br/>
giving it back to nature.

You're still at the bar. <br/>
On our balcony with a cigarette. <br/>
Afternoon coffee on the steps by the pond. <br/>
Snuggled under a blanket on the sofa. <br/>
Reading in the study. <br/>
And in my mind, I'm not <br/>
an empty space.
