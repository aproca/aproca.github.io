Today is my birthday, <br/>
like a little secret, <br/>
not a person in 4480 miles knows.

I eat fruit and drink instant coffee, <br/>
searching for a retreat that will <br/>
make it easier to starve myself. <br/>
Maybe then I’ll return to the girl <br/>
I lost 5 years ago.

I waft to a used bookstore and <br/>
pick up Kafka, a safe backup, <br/>
after the Irish owner <br/>
warned me about Proust.

I splurge on a $20 massage <br/>
which is not quite rough enough; <br/>
I guess they never are.

I call my mother for the first time <br/>
in two months, <br/>
the longest we’ve ever gone <br/>
without speaking.

My age’s label confronts me again. <br/>
You’re so young, they’ll tell me, <br/>
until I’m sixty.

Has it really been 5 years? <br/>
I’m still stuck in a loop  <br/>
that promises me “one day.”

I await buzzes of remembrances <br/>
to follow through. <br/>
I know who will call and I’m glad.

I know too who won’t, <br/>
but I still hope that for once <br/>
my intuition can be proven wrong.

Sometimes a birthday is the chance we get <br/>
to say I love you in other words.

Today is my birthday  <br/>
and I’m here.
