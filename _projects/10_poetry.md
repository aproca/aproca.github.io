When the moment of acceptance <br/>
appears and <br/>
you, <br/>
thrashing chained stallion, <br/>
renounce to fate <br/>
to swallow you whole, <br/>
a gaping cavity shall open <br/>
within your chest. 

The void of absence is always <br/>
wider than the space it filled. <br/>
It carves deeply, <br/>
making sure to leave its host <br/>
emptier each time, <br/>
until a walking carcass <br/>
is all that remains.

You have always been full, <br/>
with passion and fire and life, <br/>
which is why you can be emptied.
