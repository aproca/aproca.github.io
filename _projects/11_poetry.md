Hello from another world. <br/>
I'm feeling wistful, <br/>
as one does.

Life can be described <br/>
by too many adjectives.

Hello from out here. <br/>
Is solitude <br/>
loneliness, <br/>
or freedom?

I'm always making choices. <br/>
I'm a product <br/>
of choices. 

Which is all to say <br/>
I'm a product of <br/>
what I was always <br/>
going to become.

Isn't change strange? <br/>
She's always reminding me <br/>
what was <br/>
and its distance. 

Life's fingers stretch <br/>
so far. <br/>
It haunts me.

Hello, hi. <br/>
I only hear echoes. <br/>
Come find me.
