oh
you believe i'm a glass petal
balanced on your fingertip
a thin thread rubbing
at your sharp edges

are you blind when
i pull you from jagged cliffs,
pressing your head
against my chest
protecting you
from water's reflection?

don't bear a load
i have not asked to
you to carry
and pretend i am
helpless

to force upon me the
responsibility of expectation
is to deny the crutch
i have become
