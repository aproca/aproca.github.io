Oh <br/>
you believe I'm a glass petal <br/>
balanced on your fingertip, <br/>
a thin thread rubbing <br/>
at your sharp edges.

Are you blind when <br/>
I pull you from jagged cliffs, <br/>
pressing your head <br/>
against my chest, <br/>
protecting you <br/>
from water's reflection?

<!-- Don't bear a load <br/>
I have not asked <br/>
you to carry <br/>
and pretend I lay here, <br/>
helpless.

To force upon me the <br/>
responsibility of expectation <br/>
is to deny the crutch <br/>
I have become. -->
