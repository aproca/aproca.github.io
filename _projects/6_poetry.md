nimble little nut <br/>
with candied kernel <br/>
pensive, <br/>
tongue outstretched 

the nut wonders about <br/>
marvels of the unknown, <br/>
of existence and being. <br/>
his flesh stitches their symbol

fruits are illusory <br/>
the sweetest <br/>
don't beg <br/>
to be peeled and devoured

they hang hidden in a tree <br/>
whoever picks <br/>
knows not to search <br/>
but to discover

the days above <br/>
give time to see <br/>
somehow in some way <br/>
one finds me

nimble little nut <br/>
runs into the sea <br/>
laughing and splashing <br/>
we smile in glee
