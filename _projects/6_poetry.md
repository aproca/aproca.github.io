Nimble little nut <br/>
with candied kernel <br/>
pensive, <br/>
tongue outstretched.

The nut wonders about <br/>
marvels of the unknown, <br/>
of existence and being. <br/>
His flesh stitches their symbol.

Fruits are illusory, <br/>
the sweetest <br/>
don't beg <br/>
to be peeled and devoured.

They hang hidden in a tree, <br/>
whoever picks <br/>
knows not to search <br/>
but to discover.

The days above <br/>
give time to see, <br/>
somehow in some way <br/>
one finds me.

Nimble little nut <br/>
runs into the sea, <br/>
laughing and splashing <br/>
we smile in glee.
