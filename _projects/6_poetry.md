nimble little nut
with candied kernel
pensive,
tongue outstretched

the nut wonders about
marvels of the unknown,
of existence and being.
his flesh stitches their symbol

fruits are illusory
the sweetest
don't beg
to be peeled and devoured

they hang hidden in a tree
whoever picks
knows not to search
but to discover

the days above
give time to see
somehow in some way
one finds me

nimble little nut
runs into the sea
laughing and splashing
we smile in glee
