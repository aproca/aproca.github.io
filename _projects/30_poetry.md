One foot and another <br/>
a single beat <br/>
trash out on Tuesday <br/>
the only rigid legs here <br/>
lists to flourish <br/>
liquid breathing through <br/>
sky and slicked with sweat <br/>
are we not all born to <br/>
be lovers

The trees leaves like brilliant confetti <br/>
littering gray sidewalks <br/>
I want to bathe in it and <br/>
inhale the color to become just <br/>
as radiant <br/>
lemon glow off the pavement <br/>
it is a sea let me <br/>
plunge

A promise must stop and think <br/>
perhaps I shall not <br/>
now when November sun <br/>
leans on the porcelain houses <br/>
crimson standing in azure <br/>
for a few moments I flicker into a <br/>
tube that inhales my soul and spits <br/>
into a vacuum

You disguise yourself as a <br/>
kite but you are not my friend <br/>
I don’t know how to talk of joy but I am trying <br/>
I can’t ask for what I left or I’ll never get to ask again <br/>
I wish words would come like no <br/>
one would ever read them I’m tired of writing to you <br/>
I wish words would come like no <br/>
one would ever hear them <br/>
how can you live inside me but never speak
