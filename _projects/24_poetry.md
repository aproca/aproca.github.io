Return.

to here, to now <br/>
to there, to then

Departures, the deceptors.

In solitude, <br/>
the tree-lined path reveals secrets. <br/>
I run home to share them.

When we part, <br/>
I think of the <br/>
distance separating our <br/>
next embrace.

I move and collect, <br/>
knowing your constance, <br/>
a room in my mind <br/>
I take shelter.

Return me, return you. <br/>
Hearts parting to relish <br/>
in all that's not lost.

Leave, <br/>
but only if you come back.
