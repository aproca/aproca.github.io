i am grieving my death <br/>
within life again. <br/>
recurring like the tide. <br/>

incarnation is not meant <br/>
for the dead <br/>
but the living. <br/>

i return to constants <br/>
in some purgatory <br/>
and vanish once more to be <br/>
reborn

how many stories have i lived, <br/>
dieties have i worshipped, <br/>
characters have i enacted, <br/>
impermanent and transient as we are

maybe it's a blessing <br/>
that pain engulfs <br/>
the absence of what is <br/>
never again to be
