I am grieving my death <br/>
within life again. <br/>
Recurring like the tide. 

Reincarnation is not meant <br/>
for the dead <br/>
but the living. 

I return to constants <br/>
in some purgatory <br/>
and vanish once more to be <br/>
reborn.

How many stories have I lived, <br/>
dieties have I worshipped, <br/>
characters have I become, <br/>
impermanent and transient as we are.

Maybe it's a blessing <br/>
that pain engulfs <br/>
the absence of what is <br/>
never again to be.
