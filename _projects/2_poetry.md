why do i drown myself <br/>
swimming to <br/>
an underwater throne 

i have a burning in my soul <br/>
that warms the frigid earth, <br/>
ravenous to fest on my exisence. <br/>
to drench my body <br/>
in every taste, every touch, <br/>
every searing pain and blissful ecstasy. <br/>
i take it all, a heiden and a martyr. <br/>
i want nothing less than everything <br/>
an infinity of experience has <br/>
to offer.

i am a force and a fire. <br/>
i have all my love, my lust, my passion, <br/>
and my freedom to give, <br/>
all of it to take. <br/>
for the smallest promise, <br/>
i dive in and extinguish.

when will the siren <br/>
throw kindling in me.
