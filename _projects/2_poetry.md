why do i drown myself
swimming to
an underwater throne

i have a burning in my soul
that warms the frigid earth,
ravenous to fest on my exisence.
to drench my body
in every taste, every touch,
every searing pain and blissful ecstasy.
i take it all, a heiden and a martyr.
i want nothing less than everything
an infinity of experience has
to offer.

i am a force and a fire.
i have all my love, my lust, my passion,
and my freedom to give,
all of it to take.
for the smallest promise,
i dive in and extinguish.

when will the siren
throw kindling in me.
