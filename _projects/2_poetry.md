Why do I drown myself <br/>
swimming to <br/>
an underwater throne.

I have a burning in my soul <br/>
that warms the frigid earth, <br/>
ravenous to feast on my existence. <br/>
To drench my body <br/>
in every taste, every touch, <br/>
every searing pain and blissful ecstasy. <br/>
I take it all, a hedon and a martyr. <br/>
<!-- I want nothing less than everything <br/>
an infinity of experience has <br/>
to offer. -->

<!-- I am a force and a fire. <br/> -->
I have all my love, my lust, my passion, <br/>
and my freedom to give, <br/>
all of it to take. <br/>
For the smallest promise, <br/>
I dive in and extinguish.

When will the siren <br/>
throw kindling in me.
