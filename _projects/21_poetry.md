With rubbered cherry heads, <br/>
the roosters sound morning's arrival, <br/>
chasing each other under <br/>
verdant shrubbery on stilts.

The mind summersaults and <br/>
stretches itself like putty. <br/>
In and out I breath, <br/>
reliquinshing it to form <br/>
a kaleidoscope of color and silence.

A sudden burst of rain bats down on the roofs <br/>
and the children run and dance and ride bicycles, <br/>
screaming in the sound of innocence, <br/>
throwing off their orange garments to <br/>
receive the sky's kisses.

I sit still as the patient observer. <br/>
I am told this is where suffering ends <br/>
and I know it.
