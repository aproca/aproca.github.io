Do we destroy something <br/>
by naming it?

Stuffing complexity <br/>
into a sorted box <br/>
in search of peace.

Don't you know <br/>
we transcend it?

Forcing order out <br/>
of what knows <br/>
no boundaries, <br/>
we desicate <br/>
embodied art.

The current was not born <br/>
to be understood. <br/>
Float on and let <br/>
her bring you to wherever <br/>
she empties.
