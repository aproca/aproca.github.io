do we destroy something <br/>
by naming it?

stuffing complexity <br/>
into a sorted box <br/>
in search of peace.

don't you know <br/>
we transcend it?

forcing order out <br/>
of what knows <br/>
no boundaries, <br/>
we desicate <br/>
embodied art

the current was not born <br/>
to be understood. <br/>
float on her river and let <br/>
it bring you to wherever <br/>
it empties
