A blossom of exuberance, <br/>
birthed from parents who <br/>
still loved each other <br/>
back then.

Cheeks made of apples, <br/>
a gold dish resting over. <br/>
She danced to her father's <br/>
home copied cassettes. <br/>
She gave her mother perfume, <br/>
made from flowers stolen from <br/>
neighbors' gardens. <br/>
She made an obstacle course <br/>
for her dog <br/>
in the backyard. <br/>
She wrote stories. <br/>
She loved deeply.

Cheeks drenched in tears, <br/>
four eyes running home. <br/>
The way her flamboyance <br/>
was crushed by rigidity.

Cheeks painted with blush, <br/>
She sought for <br/>
a friend to complete her, <br/>
whom she could love without <br/>
judgement. <br/>
Instead, she found that <br/>
indifference holds power. <br/>
Interest means showing someone <br/>
they're valued, <br/>
and we don't do that <br/>
in Ohio.

Cheeks freckled, <br/>
she only plays games now. <br/>
She's lost courage, <br/>
and people.
