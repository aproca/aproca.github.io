The faded film <br/>
of a first memory, <br/>
unsure of itself. <br/>
A mop of gold toppling over <br/>
cheeks made of apples, <br/>
I had asked my mother about death <br/>
and learned the impossibility <br/>
of permanence <br/>
for the first time. 

With a tendency to forget, <br/>
reminders never fail <br/>
to follow me. <br/>
I fight, I resist, I deny. <br/>
Futile. <br/>
Marching in tempo, <br/>
splitting path forward, <br/>
the ropes of time grip my ankles. <br/>
Somehow I never learn <br/>
not to hold on <br/>
too tight.
