Embarking to greater unknowns, <br/>
I traverse miles of pavement and dirt, <br/>
hours of resigned patience, <br/>
with still the same feet. <br/>
Surroundings and perceivers, <br/>
eclose from a chrysalis, <br/>
yet static and steadfast <br/>
remains their center. <br/>
Only my face reveals <br/>
an alien <br/>
in other worlds. 

Dreams have better homes <br/>
at the horizon of possibility. <br/>
Most never venture <br/>
so far to discover <br/>
a mirage that will never quench <br/>
dying thirst.

My identity is <br/>
that of the masses and <br/>
obligation cannot find me. <br/>
Goodbye, heart of hearts, <br/>
soul of souls, <br/>
objects of desire! <br/>
My gait is relieved <br/>
of yearning that will <br/>
cripple it no longer.

Still, I despise the platitudes <br/>
loneliness forces upon me. <br/>
I remember that <br/>
absence cried loudest. <br/>
But I tire of searching for home <br/>
and finding the door bolted, <br/>
or the walls made from cards.

Nothing to run from, <br/>
to run to, <br/>
where do you go?

The child knows. <br/>
But her wisdom falters <br/>
in the hands of the enlightened man. <br/>
Must he throw himself <br/>
into the futile, <br/>
or else float in an abyss?

Fantasy, <br/>
return to the horizon <br/>
and birth the child in me.
