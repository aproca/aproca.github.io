Screaming, I reached in <br/>
and tore out everything <br/>
I could hold in my hand, <br/>
sealed it <br/>
in a locket and <br/>
buried it in the yard. <br/>
Please keep her safe, <br/>
I whispered <br/>
to the earth, my mother. <br/>
No flesh can linger <br/>
with you her guardian. <br/>
The veil of nightfall <br/>
carried me away.

So I trudged along, <br/>
no blade to pierce me, <br/>
no feather to tickle. <br/>
To be numb is <br/>
to be protected.

With kind eyes and <br/>
soft hands, <br/>
you asked to wear it. <br/>
I stole from my own grave.

Now you crush my locket <br/>
with your heel <br/>
and I return to bury <br/>
what remains.
