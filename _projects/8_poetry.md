The quick flash of pearls <br/>
as you curl your lips <br/>
blinds me. <br/>
How lovely a sight <br/>
to witness joy <br/>
come alive in your eyes. <br/>
Each angle, shade, expression <br/>
of your living self <br/>
is my peace <br/>
and I wonder <br/>
how too do I appear <br/>
in the eyes of a lover, <br/>
of someone who sees not a body to scorn <br/>
or a hated reflection? <br/>
Does my skin taste of strawberries? <br/>
Does the sun shine when I smile? <br/>
Would I too embrace my tired figure <br/>
and shower my beaten skin <br/>
with tender kisses?

I grieve at the thought <br/>
that I may never have the luxury <br/>
of hearing the slowing of my breath <br/>
as sleep envelopes me. <br/>
That I will never see <br/>
the reflection in <br/>
my candied eyes. <br/>
That I will never smell <br/>
my own scent <br/>
or give witness to the way <br/>
light reflects from my face. <br/>
I am an open book <br/>
whose pages <br/>
I do not get to read. 
<!-- I have been sentenced <br/>
to eternal blindness <br/>
of the physical manifestations <br/>
matching the universe within me. <br/>
How well can I know myself <br/>
if I am but <br/>
omniscient and ignorant. -->
