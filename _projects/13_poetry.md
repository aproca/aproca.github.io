You wanted me to flourish <br/>
into a garden <br/>
but you forgot to water me <br/>
and let me bask in the sun, <br/>
tend to my soil.

You panicked <br/>
when I didn't sprout. <br/>
You set frost upon me <br/>
and told me to grow faster.

The other flowers you cared for <br/>
bloomed tall and wide <br/>
but I stayed small <br/>
and you wondered why. <br/>

I tried I tried <br/>
but what could I do. <br/>
You pointed to them <br/>
and said why isn't it you.

The distance the distance. <br/>
You uprooted me and fled <br/>
and all I ever wanted <br/>
was just to be fed.

<!-- The distance oh the distance. <br/>
You pushed me away <br/>
and one day you'll ask <br/>
why didn't you stay. -->
