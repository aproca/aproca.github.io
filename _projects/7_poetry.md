what is a life
but forgetting and knowing?
absence swallows
the present.

a memory is a scar,
reminding what is never
again to be,
every moment a vehicle.

what do i stand with
as it all passes,
leaving marks so distant
they are not mine?

i am only today
and not yesterday,
and so is everything
i have ever loved
