What is a life <br/>
but forgetting and knowing? <br/>
Absence swallows <br/>
the present.

A memory is a scar, <br/>
reminding what is never <br/>
again to be, <br/>
every moment a vehicle.

What do i stand with <br/>
as it all passes, <br/>
leaving marks so distant <br/>
they are not mine?

I am only today <br/>
and not yesterday, <br/>
and so is everything <br/>
I have ever loved.
