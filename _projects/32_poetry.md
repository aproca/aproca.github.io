I have three figs <br/>
they are so sweet <br/>
so cold <br/>
Sunlight softens <br/>
along the draped curtains <br/>
like a veil over our room <br/>
me at the table <br/>
you sprawled upon the mattress <br/>
brought from upstairs <br/>
The tangerine cat sits at the window <br/>
of the garden <br/>
as breeze ruffles a palm <br/>
our clothes hang to dry <br/>
The soft buzz of cars and chirps of birds <br/>
a house too big for three <br/>
summerâ€™s inferno <br/>
you my refuge
