Stinging heat radiates <br/>
from beams surrounding. <br/>
Hungered, he begins to feast, <br/>
free his way. <br/>
Tender belly, inhaling beast. <br/>
Devour me inside out <br/>
as I lay watching.

Silly rat. <br/>
I too once burrowed <br/>
eager to reach each corner <br/>
of a maze skirting  <br/>
the edges of a labyrinth. <br/>
Following maps <br/>
to realize a territory <br/>
that was never mine.
