I gave a talk on *Linking generalizable intelligence to consciousness via information synergy* at the 2022 Modelling Consciousness Cabin Workshop in Dorfgastein, Austria, organized by the <a href='https://amcs-community.org/'>Association for Mathematical Consciousness Science</a>. The video here is an informal and less-rehearsed version I gave to Qualiaheads beforehand.
