I presented a poster, *Jack of All Trades, or Master of One: Distinct Features Between Generalizable and Specialized Artificial Neural Representations*, at the 25th <a href='https://theassc.org/assc-25/'>Association for the Scientific Study for Consciousness</a> meeting in Amsterdam. Some fellow <a href='https://qualiaheads.github.io/blog/'>Qualiaheads</a> also joined.
