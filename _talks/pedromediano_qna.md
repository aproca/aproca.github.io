<a href='https://qualiaheads.github.io/blog/'>Qualiaheads</a> hosted a Q&A with <a href=https://pmediano.gitlab.io/>Pedro A.M. Mediano</a>, focusing on two of his recent papers: <a href='https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2021/2/niab027/6429334?login=false'>What it is like to be a bit: an integrated information decomposition account of emergent mental phenomena</a> and <a href='https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(22)00092-4?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1364661322000924%3Fshowall%3Dtrue'>The strength of weak integrated information theory</a>. A short blog post about it can be found <a href='https://qualiaheads.github.io/blog/pedro-mediano-q-and-a'>here</a>.

Pedro Mediano is a lecturer in the Department of Computing at Imperial College London. His research spans information theory, neuroscience, consciousness science, complexity theory, and more. Much of his recent work has been based on <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1004.2515'>Partial Information Decomposition</a> (PID), which he has used to <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-022-01070-0'>study information processing in the brain</a> and <a href='https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008289'>develop a theory of emergence</a>, among other work. He is also now my PhD advisor!
