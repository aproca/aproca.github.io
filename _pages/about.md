<!-- I was born and raised in Columbus, Ohio. After enough time in the midwest, I did a bachelors degree in computer science and neuroscience (with a music minor) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Deciding I wanted to pursue the field of AI more directly, I went on to do a masters degree in machine learning at University College London. During both degrees, I worked as a research assistant in several labs on various topics in the fields of machine learning and neuroscience. After finishing my masters, I worked as a research assistant at ETH Zurich for a year, studying the use of hypernetworks for meta-learning.  -->

I'm a PhD student in the Department of Computing at Imperial College London supervised by <a href='https://pmediano.gitlab.io/'>Pedro Mediano</a>. Broadly, my research interests span the fields of computational neuroscience, information theory, machine learning, and consciousness science. In particular, I'm interested in developing general theories of learning, cognition, and consciousness to better understand both biological and artificial minds.

Before attending Imperial, I received by bachelors degree in computer science and neuroscience (with a music minor) from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and then completed a masters degree in machine learning at University College London. During my degrees, I worked as a research assistant in several labs on various topics in the fields of machine learning and neuroscience. After finishing my masters, I worked as a research assistant in the Department of Computer Science at ETH Zurich with <a href='https://www.joaosacramento.com/'>Joao Sacramento</a>, studying the use of hypernetworks for meta-learning. For more information, you can view my CV.

I really enjoy discussing and engaging with science and philosophy with other people. I currently help organize <a href='https://qualiaheads.github.io/blog/'>Qualiaheads</a>, a club of graduate students studying the state of research in consciousness science.

Outside of research, I love anything outdoors (marathon running, hiking, skiing, traveling, etc.). I also enjoy playing music and writing. I've been playing piano for 18 years and while I lived in Zurich, I was a singer in a local band. I occassionally write poetry and (less frequently) share it.
