I'm a PhD student in the Department of Computing at Imperial College London. Broadly, my research interests span the fields of computational neuroscience, information theory, machine learning, and consciousness science. In particular, I'm interested in developing general theories of learning, cognition, and consciousness to better understand both biological and artificial minds.

Before attending Imperial, I received by bachelors degree in computer science and neuroscience (with a music minor) from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and then completed a masters degree in machine learning at University College London. During that time, I worked as a research assistant in several labs on various topics in the fields of machine learning and neuroscience. I also help organize <a href='https://qualiaheads.github.io/blog/'>Qualiaheads</a>, a club of graduate students studying the current state of research in consciousness science.

Outside of research, I enjoy marathon running, playing music, and writing. I've been playing piano for 18 years and while I lived in Zurich, I was a singer in a local band. I occassionally write poetry and (less frequently) share it.
